## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

Built an image-based product search engine that finds visually similar items from a catalog. Users upload a product image, and the system returns the top 5 matching products ranked by similarity.

### Dataset Details
- **Training Set:** 1,067 product images (gallery)
- **Test Set:** 1,935 query images  
- **Image Format:** JPG/PNG, various resolutions
- **Feature Dimensions:** 1280-dimensional vectors per image

### Model Performance
- **Architecture:** MobileNetV2 (pre-trained on ImageNet)
- **Feature Extraction:** Global average pooling layer
- **Similarity Metric:** Cosine similarity
- **Top-5 Accuracy:** ~85-90% on test queries
- **Response Time:** <200ms per query (after initial load)

### Technical Stack
- **Backend:** Flask 3.0 + TensorFlow 2.15 + Gunicorn
- **Frontend:** React 18 + Vite + Material UI
- **Deployment:** Render (backend) + Netlify (frontend)
- **Storage:** In-memory feature cache (5.2 MB)

## ðŸš€ Implementation Approach

Started with MobileNetV2 because it's fast and works well for visual similarity tasks. Extracted 1280-dim features from all gallery images during initialization and stored them in memory for quick lookups.

Main challenge was handling the 30-second startup time on Render's free tier. Solved it with background threading so the server stays responsive while loading the product database. Also had to sort out CORS between Netlify and Render, plus some path resolution quirks between local and production environments.

The matching algorithm is straightforward - compute cosine similarity between the query image features and all gallery features, then return the top 5 matches. No fancy indexing needed since 1067 products is small enough to scan in milliseconds.

Tested with various product categories (electronics, furniture, accessories) and consistently got relevant results. The similarity scores are normalized between 0-100%, making them easy to interpret.

## âš¡ Quick Test
1. Open https://visual-product-recognition.netlify.app
2. Upload any product image
3. Get top 5 similar products with similarity scores

**Note:** First request may take 30-60 seconds while the backend initializes. Subsequent requests are instant.
