### 4. **Backend Image Serving (app.py)**

@app.route('/images/<path:filename>')
def serve_image(filename):
    """Serve product images from the dataset"""
```

**Features:**
- Properly serves images from development_test_data folder
- Uses absolute paths to avoid file not found errors
- Handles nested paths (gallery/image.jpg)
- CORS enabled for frontend access

**Import Added:**
- `send_from_directory` from Flask for proper file serving

### 5. **Path Fixes**

**Frontend:**

**Backend:**
- Fixed relative path issues using `os.path.abspath(__file__)`
